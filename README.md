# orb-mcu-firmware

West workspace for microcontrollers' firmware.

This repo contains Firmware for the several microcontrollers present in the Orb:

- ‚òÄÔ∏è Main board microcontroller
  - Anything related to board supplies and controlling sensors on the Orb
- üö® Security board microcontroller
  - Anything related to security: signing data and anti-fraud sensors

## Setting Up Development Environment

You can set up your development environment directly on your machine (preferred for Windows users), or you may
use the provided Docker image. A step-by-step guide is available below.
Note that all of these steps assume that you have an SSH key set up properly with Github
and that you have access to all the MCU repos. These repositories are
enumerated in the [west.yml](west.yml) file.

### Generic Steps

1. Install the `west` meta-tool.

   ```shell
   pip3 install west
   ```

2. Create an empty directory where we will put our projects and dependencies. We assume that you set an environmental
   variable called `REPO_DIR`. I like to set this to `$HOME/firmware`.

   ```shell
   export REPO_DIR=$HOME/firmware # This env var is used inside the Docker Makefile, hence the need for `export`
   mkdir "$REPO_DIR"
   ```

3. Clone the manifest repository using west.

   ```shell
   cd "$REPO_DIR"
   west init -m git@github.com:worldcoin/orb-mcu-firmware.git --mr main
   ```

   This will create a directory called `orb`.

4. Now import all projects and dependencies.

   ```shell
   west update
   ```

#### Docker-specific Steps (Linux-based OS)

5. Enter the Docker container to perform your work. (Note: you need to first configure Github to read
   the [container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry))

   ```shell
   cd "$REPO_DIR"/orb/utils/docker
   make shell
   ```

You may also build the Docker image locally.
NOTE: when you build locally, you will get a image with the tag `local`,
but when you run `make *-build`, Make will use the SHA of the known good
Docker image used by CI, _unless_ you set the make variable
`DOCKER_TAG` to something. For instance, do
`make main_board-build DOCKER_TAG=local` to use the Docker image you built
locally.
This locally-built image may not work since Ubuntu-based containers
are not strictly reproducible.

```shell
cd "$REPO_DIR"/orb/utils/docker
make build
```

#### Native-specific Steps

These instructions are mainly just an adaptation of the instructions in
the [Zephyr getting started guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html).

5. Install the dependencies. Two ways:

   - Follow instructions in this section
     for [installing dependencies](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html#install-dependencies)
     , and only this section (don't install Zephyr & Python deps yet). Preferred method for Windows/WSL2.
   - Or install the Conda environment provided [here](utils/env/environment.yml). Make sure to set the variables.
     ```shell
     conda env create -f orb/utils/env/environement.yml
     conda activate worldcoin
     ```

6. Export CMake packages.

   ```shell
   cd "$REPO_DIR"
   west zephyr-export
   ```

7. Install additional Python dependencies.

   ```shell
   pip3 install -r "$REPO_DIR"/zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
   ```

8. Install a toolchain.

   You may change `INSTALL_LOC` to choose an installation location.
   You may also change `SDK_VER` to choose a specific toolchain version.
   We removed the toolchain from the Conda environment due to the many architectures and dependencies.

   ```shell
   tmp=$(mktemp)
   cat > "$tmp" <<EOF
   #!/bin/bash
   set -ue
   set -o pipefail
   install_zephyr_sdk() {
    INSTALL_LOC=\$HOME
    KERNEL=\$(uname -s | tr '[[:upper:]]' '[[:lower:]]')
    [ "\$KERNEL" = darwin ] && KERNEL=macos
    ARCH=\$(uname -m)
    [ "\$ARCH" = arm64 ] && ARCH=aarch64
    if [ -z "\${SDK_VER-}" ]; then
        if ! SDK_VER=\$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/latest \\
            | grep tag_name \\
            | awk '{print substr(\$2, 3, length(\$2)-4)}'); then
            echo "Some error occured when trying to determine the latest SDK version" >&2
            return 1
        fi
    fi
    echo "SDK_VER is '\$SDK_VER'"
    TAR_NAME=zephyr-sdk-\${SDK_VER}_\${KERNEL}-\${ARCH}_minimal.tar.gz
    echo "TAR_NAME is \$TAR_NAME"
    URL=https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/download/v\${SDK_VER}/\${TAR_NAME}
    if [ ! -e "\$INSTALL_LOC/zephyr-sdk-\${SDK_VER}/.__finished" ]; then
        echo "Downloading \${TAR_NAME}..." &&
        ( cd "\$INSTALL_LOC" && curl -JLO "\$URL" ) &&
        echo 'Decompressing...' &&
        (cd "\$INSTALL_LOC" && tar xf "\$TAR_NAME" ) &&
        ( cd "\$INSTALL_LOC"/zephyr-sdk-\${SDK_VER} &&
        ./setup.sh -t arm-zephyr-eabi -h -c ) &&
        rm "\$INSTALL_LOC/\$TAR_NAME" &&
        echo > "\$INSTALL_LOC"/zephyr-sdk-\${SDK_VER}/.__finished
    else
        echo "SDK already exists. Skipping."
    fi
   }
   install_zephyr_sdk
   EOF
   chmod +x "$tmp"
   "$tmp"
   ```

9. Install udev rules to allow for flashing as a non-root user (For Linux only).

   ```shell
   sudo cp zephyr-sdk-${SDK_VER}/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/share/openocd/contrib/60-openocd.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
   sudo udevadm control --reload
   ```

10. Install the protobuf compiler.

    ```shell
    if [ "$(uname -s)" = Darwin ]; then
        brew install protobuf-c
    else
        sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
    fi
    pip3 install protobuf grpcio-tools
    ```

11. Install CMSIS Pack for PyOCD

    ```shell
    pyocd pack install stm32g474vetx
    ```

12. You may need to fix up some Python dependencies:
    ```shell
    pip3 install six==1.15.0
    pip3 install pyyaml==6.0
    ```

Your directory structure now looks similar to this:

```
firmware
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bootloader
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orb
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ zephyr
```

#### Finally, to Build and Flash

See the board-specific docs:

- ‚òÄÔ∏è [Main board](main_board/app/README.md)
- üö® [Security board](sec_board/app/README.md)

#### Debugging

Use [openOCD with Zephyr patches](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/openocd) to get the most out of your
debugging experience, either from the [Zephyr SDK](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng) (in Host Tools) or
compiled manually using [this script](utils/env/compile_openocd.sh).

To fully use the thread-aware debugging, make sure to use:

```conf
CONFIG_DEBUG_THREAD_INFO=y
```

#### Logging

Print out the bootloader and main MCU application logs using:

```shell
# replace /dev/ttyxxx with your UART device
python "$REPO_DIR"/orb/utils/debug/uart_dump.py -p /dev/ttyxxx -b 115200
```

##### Security board logs

UART is not easily accessible on the Security Board 2.x so the default logging backend is using SeggerRTT (logs sent
through the debugger SWD interface). From `pyocd` v0.33.1, printing RTT logs is as simple as:

```shell
pyocd rtt --target=stm32g474vetx
```
