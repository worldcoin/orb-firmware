/* Before including this file (pkcs11.h) (or pkcs11t.h by
 * itself), 5 platform-specific macros must be defined.  These
 * macros are described below, and typical definitions for them
 * are also given.  Be advised that these definitions can depend
 * on both the platform and the compiler used (and possibly also
 * on whether a Cryptoki library is linked statically or
 * dynamically).
 *
 * In addition to defining these 5 macros, the packing convention
 * for Cryptoki structures should be set.  The Cryptoki
 * convention on packing is that structures should be 1-byte
 * aligned.
 *
 * If you're using Microsoft Developer Studio 5.0 to produce
 * Win32 stuff, this might be done by using the following
 * preprocessor directive before including pkcs11.h or pkcs11t.h:
 *
 * #pragma pack(push, cryptoki, 1)
 *
 * and using the following preprocessor directive after including
 * pkcs11.h or pkcs11t.h:
 *
 * #pragma pack(pop, cryptoki)
 *
 * If you're using an earlier version of Microsoft Developer
 * Studio to produce Win16 stuff, this might be done by using
 * the following preprocessor directive before including
 * pkcs11.h or pkcs11t.h:
 *
 * #pragma pack(1)
 *
 * In a UNIX environment, you're on your own for this.  You might
 * not need to do (or be able to do!) anything.
 *
 *
 * Now for the macros:
 *
 *
 * 1. CK_PTR: The indirection string for making a pointer to an
 * object.  It can be used like this:
 *
 * typedef CK_BYTE CK_PTR CK_BYTE_PTR;
 *
 * If you're using Microsoft Developer Studio 5.0 to produce
 * Win32 stuff, it might be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_PTR *
 *
 * If you're using an earlier version of Microsoft Developer
 * Studio to produce Win16 stuff, it might be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_PTR far *
 *
 * In a typical UNIX environment, it might be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_PTR *
 *
 *
 * 2. CK_DECLARE_FUNCTION(returnType, name): A macro which makes
 * an importable Cryptoki library function declaration out of a
 * return type and a function name.  It should be used in the
 * following fashion:
 *
 * extern CK_DECLARE_FUNCTION(CK_RV, C_Initialize)(
 *   CK_VOID_PTR pReserved
 * );
 *
 * If you're using Microsoft Developer Studio 5.0 to declare a
 * function in a Win32 Cryptoki .dll, it might be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_DECLARE_FUNCTION(returnType, name) \
 *   returnType __declspec(dllimport) name
 *
 * If you're using an earlier version of Microsoft Developer
 * Studio to declare a function in a Win16 Cryptoki .dll, it
 * might be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_DECLARE_FUNCTION(returnType, name) \
 *   returnType __export _far _pascal name
 *
 * In a UNIX environment, it might be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_DECLARE_FUNCTION(returnType, name) \
 *   returnType name
 *
 *
 * 3. CK_DECLARE_FUNCTION_POINTER(returnType, name): A macro
 * which makes a Cryptoki API function pointer declaration or
 * function pointer type declaration out of a return type and a
 * function name.  It should be used in the following fashion:
 *
 *  Define funcPtr to be a pointer to a Cryptoki API function
 *  taking arguments args and returning CK_RV.
 * CK_DECLARE_FUNCTION_POINTER(CK_RV, funcPtr)(args);
 *
 * or
 *
 *  Define funcPtrType to be the type of a pointer to a
 *  Cryptoki API function taking arguments args and returning
 *  CK_RV, and then define funcPtr to be a variable of type
 *  funcPtrType.
 * typedef CK_DECLARE_FUNCTION_POINTER(CK_RV, funcPtrType)(args);
 * funcPtrType funcPtr;
 *
 * If you're using Microsoft Developer Studio 5.0 to access
 * functions in a Win32 Cryptoki .dll, in might be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_DECLARE_FUNCTION_POINTER(returnType, name) \
 *   returnType __declspec(dllimport) (* name)
 *
 * If you're using an earlier version of Microsoft Developer
 * Studio to access functions in a Win16 Cryptoki .dll, it might
 * be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_DECLARE_FUNCTION_POINTER(returnType, name) \
 *   returnType __export _far _pascal (* name)
 *
 * In a UNIX environment, it might be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_DECLARE_FUNCTION_POINTER(returnType, name) \
 *   returnType (* name)
 *
 *
 * 4. CK_CALLBACK_FUNCTION(returnType, name): A macro which makes
 * a function pointer type for an application callback out of
 * a return type for the callback and a name for the callback.
 * It should be used in the following fashion:
 *
 * CK_CALLBACK_FUNCTION(CK_RV, myCallback)(args);
 *
 * to declare a function pointer, myCallback, to a callback
 * which takes arguments args and returns a CK_RV.  It can also
 * be used like this:
 *
 * typedef CK_CALLBACK_FUNCTION(CK_RV, myCallbackType)(args);
 * myCallbackType myCallback;
 *
 * If you're using Microsoft Developer Studio 5.0 to do Win32
 * Cryptoki development, it might be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_CALLBACK_FUNCTION(returnType, name) \
 *   returnType (* name)
 *
 * If you're using an earlier version of Microsoft Developer
 * Studio to do Win16 development, it might be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_CALLBACK_FUNCTION(returnType, name) \
 *   returnType _far _pascal (* name)
 *
 * In a UNIX environment, it might be defined by:
 *
 * #define CK_CALLBACK_FUNCTION(returnType, name) \
 *   returnType (* name)
 *
 *
 * 5. NULL_PTR: This macro is the value of a NULL pointer.
 *
 * In any ANSI/ISO C environment (and in many others as well),
 * this should best be defined by
 *
 * #ifndef NULL_PTR
 * #define NULL_PTR 0
 * #endif
