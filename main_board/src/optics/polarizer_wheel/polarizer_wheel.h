 * The goal is to detect the 2-dash long number of steps between 3 and 0 and to
 * stop at notch #0, with the wheel spinning from left to right.
 *
 * Homing procedure:
 * 1. The wheel spins up to a first notch, that can be anywhere, very close or
 * not, since the initial wheel position is unknown.
 * 2. Once that notch is detected, the wheel spins until a short number of steps
 * between two notches is detected (2-dash segment above), meaning the home
 * position (0) is reached.
 * 3. The **edge** of notch #0 is reached but the wheel needs to be centered on
 * that notch, so a few more steps are performed to go home.
 *
 * The maximum number of steps perform is if the initial position is between
 * notch #3 and #0 (more than one entire revolution)
